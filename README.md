# Updated-Krupt-Console-Application
Updated repository derived from the Krupt Console Helper.


In the previous release the repo contained an .exe file which is not acceptable. Apologies for the mistake.
In this new version I added:

-Headers for the source code
-The Krupt source file is updated
-Files are added to a zipped folder
-Easier to transfer
-Security patches

-LinkedIn

New updates coming soon.
